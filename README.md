# Framer
A janky-ish, in-development, web-framework. If you have VSCode most of the hard setup has been done for you, just download the example project and get started. In the example project you will find I have predefined two helpful VSCode snippets, cfa and cfc. cfa creates a template for a Framer Application and cfc creates a template for a Framer Component.
